# Aeb
Axle Web - A platform for creating fully functional webpages with javascript speed and capability... From another language.

Our plans...
AxleScript - Compiles to JavaScript, Built in lua.
```
Document = Reference "axlejs.document"
Ajs = Reference "axlejs.stdjs"
Html = Reference "axlejs.stdmu.html"
Aeb = Reference "aeb.axlejs.std"
Console = Aeb.jsconsole()

Console.Out("Hello to browser from Javascript from Axlescript!")
```
Support for fully interactive webpages made with lua, python, and rust (we're starting small!)
